    <i> “People I didn't know formed a circle around me, sheltering me from view. They escorted me safely <br>
      back to our jurta, undetected. They didn't ask for anything. They were happy to help someone, to succeed at something, <br>
      even if they weren't to benefit. We'd been trying to touch the sky from the bottom of the ocean. I realized that <br>
      if we boosted one another, maybe we'd get a little closer.” </i>

      <h1> A little bit about myself... </h1>
      <p> I am an upcoming junior at Los Altos High School. I am Taiwanese (both my parents grew up in Taiwan). I speak
      Taiwanese (only the basics but I am learning), Chinese, and English. My favorite color is black and blue.
      I love wolves and huskies. I play badminton. In my free time, I enjoy playing the violin, writing, and reading.  </p>
