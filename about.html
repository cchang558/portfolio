  <div id = "about-textbox">
    <p> I am an upcoming junior at Los Altos High School. I have lived in Los Altos all my life. Well, except
      for the first few months which I lived in Mountain View and for a few weeks in sixth grade which I moved to Palo Alto.
      I am Taiwanese (both my parents grew up in Taiwan). I speak Taiwanese (only the basics but I am learning), Chinese, and English.
      I played soccer for seven to eight years before I moved on to badminton, which I have been playing for the last two years
      (since I entered the high school badminton team). My favorite animals are wolves and huskies. I love to read books. My favorite
      book is Between Shades of Grey by Ruta Sepetys. The setting takes place in the 1940s... Some of the games I like to play are
      SimCity Buildit (3 months), Clash of Clans (4 years), and Puzzles and Dragons (2 years). I learned Java during my sophomore year.
      I came to this camp to learn different languages and see how each one is applied to the programming world.
